<EM>Abstract:</EM>  We have seen hashing as a technique for obtaining
expected constant-time operations on finding or inserting elements in a set.
Hashing is also used to compute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature"> digital signatures</a> for confirming the authenticity of messages.
<p>
In this assignment, you will apply a hashing scheme in pursuit of finding
occurences of one string in another,
using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabin%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm">Rabin&ndash;Karp algorithm</a>.
<p>
That algorithm is discussed in Section 32.2 of our text, on page 990.
<HR>
<H2>Introduction</H2>
Suppose we have two strings of interest:
<DL>
  <DT> <KBD>target</KBD>
  <DD> is a relatively long string of length <i>n</i>.
   <DT> <KBD>query</KBD>
   <DD> is a relatively short string of length <i>m</i>.
</DL>
We are interested in finding all occurrences of <KBD>query</KBD> in <KBD>target</KBD>.
For example, consider the <KBD>query</KBD>&nbsp;<KBD>aaba</KBD>  and
the <KBD>target</KBD>&nbsp;<KBD>aabaacaadaabaabaa</KBD>.  
The last character of the query occurs within the
target as shown below:
<PRE>
a a b a a c a a d a a b a a b a a
       |                 |     |
a a b a                  |     |
                  a a b a      |
                        a a b a
</PRE>
Notice that the second and third matches overlap.  As discused in class,
the most straightforward algorithm is as follows:
<PRE>
   for each i in the interval [0, n)
      match = true
      for each j in the interval [0, m)
          if target[i+j] &ne; query[j]
             match = false
          end if
      end for
      if match
         // definite match of query starting at index i of target
       end if
   end for
</PRE>
The worst-case complexity of this approach is 
&Theta;(mn).
<H2>Rabin&ndash;Karp Algorithm</H2>
Instead of trying to match the query at each location in the target, the
Rabin&ndash;Karp Algorithm computes a <i>rolling hash</i> of a window
of <i>m</i> characters of the target.   Near the beginning of the target, where
there may not be <i>m</i> characters in the window, the value 0 is 
used for those
entries outside of the target.
<p>
We will use in particular the following hash function for a window
of size <i>m</i> in a character array, with the first character of
the window at index <KBD>start</KBD>:
<PRE>
private static int hashFor(char[] chars, int start, int m) {
   int ans = 0;
   for (int i=start; i &lt; start+m; ++i) {
      int val = 0;
      //
      // Within the bounds of the chars array?
      //
      if (i &ge; 0 &amp;&amp; i &lt; chars.length) 
         val = chars[i];                        // then use the character value there
      ans = mod(
                mod(31*ans, 511) + mod(val, 511), 
                511
               );
   }
   return ans;
}
</PRE>
The above function is similar to how Java computes <KBD>.hashCode()</KBD> for
a <KBD>String</KBD>, except that we confine the results to being strictly less
than 511 using <EM>mod</EM> (the <KBD>%</KBD> operator).  The following
identities related to mod should be useful in this assignment:
<UL>
  <LI> (a + b) mod p = ( (a mod p) + (b mod p) ) mod p
  <LI> (a &times; b) mod p = ( (a mod p) &times; (b mod p) ) mod p
</UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You should investigate how large the intermediate results of addition
and multiplication can get before the final <EM>mod p</EM> is applied.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
Applied to our running example, the rolling hash values at the end of each window within our target string are as follows:
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD> <KBD>a</KBD></TD><TD> </TD><TD><KBD>a</KBD></TD><TD> </TD><TD><KBD>b</KBD></TD><TD> </TD><TD><KBD>a</KBD></TD><TD> </TD><TD><KBD>a</KBD></TD><TD> </TD><TD><KBD>c</KBD></TD><TD> </TD><TD><KBD>a</KBD></TD><TD> </TD><TD><KBD>a</KBD></TD><TD> </TD><TD><KBD>d</KBD></TD><TD> </TD><TD><KBD>a</KBD></TD><TD> </TD><TD><KBD>a</KBD></TD><TD> </TD><TD><KBD>b</KBD></TD><TD> </TD><TD><KBD>a</KBD></TD><TD> </TD><TD><KBD>a</KBD></TD><TD> </TD><TD><KBD>b</KBD></TD><TD> </TD><TD><KBD>a</KBD></TD><TD> </TD><TD><KBD>a</KBD></TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD> </TD><TD>97</TD><TD> </TD><TD>38</TD><TD> </TD><TD>254</TD><TD> </TD><TD><FONT COLOR="RED">306</FONT></TD><TD> </TD><TD>214</TD><TD> </TD><TD>430</TD><TD> </TD><TD>337</TD><TD> </TD><TD>153</TD><TD> </TD><TD>73</TD><TD> </TD><TD>368</TD><TD> </TD><TD>92</TD><TD> </TD><TD>224</TD><TD> </TD><TD><FONT COLOR="RED">306</FONT></TD><TD> </TD><TD>214</TD><TD> </TD><TD>429</TD><TD> </TD><TD><FONT COLOR="RED">306</FONT></TD><TD> </TD><TD>214
</TR>
</TABLE>
<UL>
<LI>
Note that at the end of each <KBD>aaba</KBD> substring, the hash value
<FONT COLOR="RED">306</FONT> is produced.
<LI> Thus, each time the rolling hash produces <FONT COLOR="RED">306</FONT>, we
probably have a match of <KBD>aaba</KBD> in the target.
<LI> No other window produces the <FONT COLOR="RED">306</FONT> hash value,
so we were lucky in this example:  the hash value <FONT COLOR="RED">306</FONT>
produced matches only for our query.
</UL>
The Rabin&ndash;Karp (RK) algorithm is essentially as follows:
<UL>
  <LI> Compute the RK hash for the query string of interest.  
<BLOCKQUOTE>In our running
example, that hash value is <FONT COLOR="RED">306</FONT>, which can be computed by 
invoking
<KBD>hashFor("aaba".toCharArray(), 0, 4)</KBD>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI> For each index <em>i</em> of the target string, 
compute the rolling hash of the target that begins at index
<EM>i-m+1</EM> and has length <EM>m</EM>.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI> 
In the example, the value for the first <KBD>a</KBD> is computed at indices
-3, -2, -1, and 0, for a window of length 4 that ends at the first index
of the target.  The numerical values for characters outside the window are 0,
and the numerical value for <KBD>a</KBD> is its <a href="http://www.asciitable.com/">ASCII encoding</a> of 97.
<LI> Thus, the window for <KBD>a</KBD> (the first character in our
target string)  has hash value 97.  
<LI> Moving one character to the right encounters another <KBD>a</KBD>.  Its
hash value is at indices -2, -1, 0, and 1, which produces 31&times;97+97,
which is 3104, but taken mod 511 is 38.
<LI> Thus the window for <KBD>a a</KBD> (the first two characters in
our target string) has value 38.
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI> <B>
However, if we compute the rolling hash by calling the <KBD>hashFor</KBD> method above,
the complexity is still
&Theta;(mn).</B>  
<LI> Your task is to compute that rolling hash incrementally,
as described below.
</UL>
<H2>Your assignment</H2>
<UL>
  <LI> Update your repository as usual.
  <LI> In the <KBD>rabinkarp</KBD> package of the <KBD>labs</KBD> source
folder, find and open the <KBD>RK</KBD> class.
  <LI> The constructor accepts the value of <i>m</I>, which is the length
of the query string in this assignment.
  <LI> The method <KBD>int nextCh(char c)</KBD> accepts a character supplied
from outside, and returns the rolling KR hash of it and the previous
<i>m-1</i> characters.
</UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You must complete the constructor and the <KBD>nextCh</KBD> method,
subject to the constraints stated below.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
In terms of our running example, the following calls after instantiation of
a <KBD>KR(4)</KBD> object would return values as follows:
<UL>
   <LI> <KBD>nextCh('a')</KBD> &rarr; 98
   <LI> <KBD>nextCh('a')</KBD> &rarr; 38
   <LI> <KBD>nextCh('b')</KBD> &rarr; 254
   <LI> <KBD>nextCh('a')</KBD> &rarr; <FONT COLOR="RED">306</FONT>
   <LI> <KBD>nextCh('a')</KBD> &rarr; 214
   <LI> <KBD>nextCh('c')</KBD> &rarr; 430
</UL>
<p>
To receive full credit for this lab, your solution must:
<UL>
  <LI> Produce the correct hash results using an incremental approach,
taking constant (<EM>&Theta;(1)</EM>) time.  This means  your approach must
take less than <EM>&Omega;(m)</em> time.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
  <LI> Suppose <EM>h</EM> is the hash value of a window of <i>m</i> characters.
  <LI> Suppose character <em>c</em> is about to leave that window, and
      character <em>d</EM> is the next to be incorporated into the window.
  <LI> We can compute the new value of h using:
<em>
  h = (h&times;31 &ndash; 31<sup>m</sup>&times;c + d) mod 511
</em>
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI> Ensure that the above computation does not cause overflow, taking care
to keep the numbers <em>mod 511</em> wherever possible.
  <LI> Use space proportional only to <I>m</I>, which is the size of
the sliding window.
  <LI> Implement a circular buffer as described in class, of size <I>m</I>, 
to keep track of the
last <I>m</I> characters seen.
  <LI> Pass the unit tests.

Note that we will run your solution against the JUnit test as it was
given to you.  If you modify that test in some way, the results you see may
not correspond with the testing necessary to receive credit.  
<p>You can always
revert any changes you make to the testing code back to what we gave you in
the repository using <KBD>Team&hellip;Revert</KBD>, but be sure not to do that
to your source code as it will wipe away work you may not have yet committed.
